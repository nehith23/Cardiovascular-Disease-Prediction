# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction

# Overview
This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) based on a variety of patient health metrics. By analyzing factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other key health indicators, our model seeks to identify individuals at high risk of CVDs, enabling early intervention and preventative care strategies.

# Features
1. Data Processing: Clean, preprocess, and normalize data to prepare it for analysis.
2. Model Training: Use machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks to train the prediction model.
3. Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. Prediction: Deploy the model to predict an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease based on their health data.

# How It Works
The project follows a structured approach to predict CVDs:

1. Data Collection: Utilize publicly available health datasets or collaborate with healthcare providers to gather anonymized patient data.
2. Feature Selection: Identify and select the most relevant health metrics that contribute to the prediction of CVDs.
3. Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.
4. Model Deployment: Implement the trained model into a usable format, such as a web application or API, for easy access by healthcare professionals or direct consumers.
